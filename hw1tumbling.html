      <h4><i><u>tumbling</u></i></h4>
        <p><em>...I keep tumbling forward as this goal I move toward remains undefined but I laugh and I cry and each moment I try not to stop or give up...not to use up my luck...to keep giving a fuck...but I don't. I don't fret I don't care about you and what's fair or what's right and what's wrong, ha, this ethical storm we're all slapped with each day is a game I don't play, it's a torment I scorn, it's a time that I warn you don't spend getting torn by I beg you make haste and don't add to the waste of the seconds that grind you so thin you can't breathe or escape or retrieve back the days that you gave making things fall in line with what people define as the true path to peace it's a joke it's a tease I dare you to release yourself from all this shit man we're drowning in it and I know that you feel it, it's groping you, fear it, and turn - NOW - and run from that thing they named sun so you'd have a small reason to wake every season and head into "work" so the moral ass clerk can look you in the eye and decide if you tried to please him and his boss while the things you have lost keep on piling high and their pockets get lined with the skin on your back and your heart starts to crack and give in as they tell you your winning, but inside your spinning so fast you can't stop and your mind starts to rot til you hate him and her and you lose the one girl you loved more than it all, till your mother she falls, never gets up, she's gone, ALL the stuff you forgot matters shatters and splatters all over the past and you race round the track while forgetting to stop till slowly forms a rock that you crash into, pop, and comes down the veil that you knew not was there and it's too late you spent it, you're wasted, forget it, they took everything and...you'll wish you had listened...
