      <p><em>...walk with me, talk with me, fly with me, cry with me, win, lose, get confused, kick off those shoes, relax, but not too much, I do not trust this faith in truth, these simple rules, Siddhartha's logic is just too loose and I've been packed down too damn hard by all this greed and lust this smog and dust it hurts my chest it breaks my sense and as I try to hop this fence I learn to quick it won’t relent so turning fast to hit the road with broken brow and severed soul and never knowing where to go, I slow. Please someone tell me the way, I couldn’t stay, I left before the sun came up that day, my heart is drain, my shoes are frayed and I’ll need a hand if I’m to stand so, come with me, walk with me, talk with me, read it all out of me and suck it all in, now release out, in, out, in, out...
