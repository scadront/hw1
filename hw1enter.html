      <p><em>I dunno. I guess the thing to note is that I don’t feel very strongly about anything in particular. But that’s really a result of feeling much too strongly about everything. How can we be expected to have sturdy opinions or take sides or hold truths to be self-evident when everything is so chaotic? I dig this world. If I spend enough time talking to anyone about something they really care about deep down in their core, I’ll start to care about it too, just because I’m in awe of their devotion and certainty. It’s all changing so fast; it’s so volatile; so transient. In a world like this, I don’t feel like I have the power to claim I know any thing for sure, to label something, to be anything.
